# SensAi

This is the code for a Facebook messenger bot that allows the user to find the URL to an ASL video representation based on an input word. The messenger bot uses Wit.AI and NLP to guess with confidence % what the word in a user question is and finds the word's link in the database.

Work is done using: Node.js, Python, CSV, Wit.AI, Messenger Facebook Developer Tools, Webhook and ngrok.
